StringBuilder and StringBuffer in Java are mutable classes designed for efficient string manipulation, allowing developers to modify character sequences without creating new, discarded objects in heap memory, which is a major advantage over the immutable String class. Both classes offer similar APIs, including append(), insert(), delete(), and reverse() methods. The critical difference lies in thread safety: StringBuffer is synchronized, making it thread-safe and suitable for multi-threaded environments, but slightly slower due to the overhead of locking. Conversely, StringBuilder is not synchronized, making it unsafe for multiple threads but significantly faster, rendering it the preferred choice for single-threaded applications or local method variables. Both classes have a default initial capacity of 16 characters, which automatically expands if the string size exceeds the capacity.
